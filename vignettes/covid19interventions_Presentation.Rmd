## Overview
- COVID-19 is an infectious and easily communicable virus
- The U.S. confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on _Jan. 21, 2020_
- On _Feb. 26, 2020_, the first suspected case of a community spread in the U.S. reported
- Local government bodies were first to enforce stay-at-home orders to prevent the spread of COVID-19 before statewide measures implemented


## Goal
- Identify counties that enforced stay-at-home measures before their state to address the COVID-19 pandemic 
- Understand if the county and state level intervention to minimize direct human contact affects the curve

## Methodology
- Initially collected data for all types of county-level interventions
- Focused on the two least and most populated counties in every state
- The process was slow- most counties did not have any interventions in place
- In the interest of time, limited interventions to stay-at-home orders only
- Google's Mobility dataset utilized to expedite the collection process by observing the change in movement at the county level

## Change in Mobility
- Movement information released by Google to support data-driven decision making in managing COVID-19
- Collected through Google products such as Google Maps
- Data reports percent change in movement across places in comparison to the median trend seen between _Jan. 3, 2020_ and _Feb. 5, 2020_
- Used to identify counties with the highest drop in workplace visits, potentially as a result of a county-level stay-at-home order

## Changepoint Analysis
- Changepoint detection technique used to determine the change in workplace mobility curve before a statewide stay-at-home was order implemented
- Specifically, At-Most-One-Change (AMOC) method used to identify a single point of significant change 
- Mean of workplace mobility calculated pre and post changepoint for every county
- Counties with the lowest mean for workplace visits post changepoint prioritized in the data collection process

## Change in Mobility by County

## Rationale 
- Population density is one of the biggest factors in a pandemic
- Policy for COVID-19 has been decided on by governors in particular
- Expressing a Governor's political party will build overall trends in decision making for the US as a whole 
- Intervention types across the US were very different from Stay at home minors, to shelter in place
- Interventions also occurred across both March of 2020 and April 2020
  
## Population vs Intervention Date
- This chart shows the intervention date with the total population of the state. N/A for the party is for territory without a governor
- There is a clear difference in the political party's by the state for the state's intervention date
- Democrats tend to be earlier by the republicans were later in March and early April.

```

## Political Party vs State Intervention Date
- Overall it shows the bipartisan policy between states for a stay at home order
- The chart shows the clear dominance geographically of the stay at home order
- Note this table leaves off 9 states that have no SAH order (of any type)

```


## Flattening the Curve
- Did SAH interventions impact the curve?

- Methodology
  1. "Linearize" exponential rise of cases using natural log\
  \
  <center> y = A$e^{kt}$ &rarr; ln(y) = kt + ln(A) </center>
  \
  2. Smooth natural log scale graph
  3. Calculate slope k between all the datepoints
  4. Locate breakpoints in k curve to find dates of greates slope change
  5. Calculate the "lag" between the SAH order date and the last breakpoint

## San Diego County, California

```{r, out.width = "700px", fig.align='center'}

```

## Future Work
- Investigate impact of different intervention measures
- Relate political party to date of SAH intervention
- Consider additional variables, such as rurality
- Quantitative analysis on lag dates
- Pair lag data with mobility data (Google + Unacast Scoreboard)
- Interesting opportunities for analysis as intervention measures are uplifted

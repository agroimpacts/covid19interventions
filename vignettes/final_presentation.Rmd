## Overview
- The U.S. confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on _Jan. 21, 2020_
- On _Feb. 26, 2020_, the first suspected case of a community spread in the U.S. reported
- Local government bodies were first to enforce stay-at-home orders to prevent the spread of COVID-19 before statewide measures implemented

## Goal
- Identify counties that enforced stay-at-home measures before their state to address the COVID-19 pandemic 
- Understand if the county-level intervention to minimize direct human contact affects the curve

## Methodology
- Initially collected data for all types of county-level interventions
- Focused on the two least and most populated counties in every state
- The process was slow- most counties did not have any interventions in place
- In the interest of time, limited interventions to stay-at-home orders only
- Google's Mobility dataset utilized to expedite the collection process by observing the change in movement at the county level

## Change in Mobility
- Movement information released by Google to support data-driven decision making in managing COVID-19
- Collected through Google products such as Google Maps
- Data reports percent change in movement across places in comparison to the median trend seen between _Jan. 3, 2020_ and _Feb. 5, 2020_
- Used to identify counties with the highest drop in workplace visits, potentially as a result of a county-level stay-at-home order

## Changepoint Analysis
- Changepoint detection technique used to determine the change in workplace mobility curve before a statewide stay-at-home was order implemented
- Specifically, At-Most-One-Change (AMOC) method used to identify a single point of significant change 
- Mean of workplace mobility calculated pre and post changepoint for every county
- Counties with the lowest mean for workplace visits post changepoint prioritized in the data collection process

## Change in Mobility by County

## Rationale- NOAH 
- Why we collected the attributes we did?
- Variety of variables that could have influenced a later SAH order

## Pop vs Intervention Date- NOAH

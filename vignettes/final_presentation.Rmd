## Overview
- The U.S. confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on _Jan. 21, 2020_
- On _Feb. 26, 2020_, the first suspected case of a community spread in the U.S. reported
- Local government bodies were first to enforce stay-at-home orders to prevent the spread of COVID-19 before statewide measures implemented

## Goal
- Identify counties that enforced stay-at-home measures before their state to address the COVID-19 pandemic 
- Understand if the county-level intervention to minimize direct human contact affects the curve

## Methodology
- Initially collected data for all types of county-level interventions
- Focused on the two least and most populated counties in every state
- The process was slow- most counties did not have any interventions in place
- In the interest of time, limited interventions to stay-at-home orders only
- Google's Mobility dataset utilized to expedite the collection process by observing the change in movement at the county level

## Change in Mobility
- Movement information released by Google to support data-driven decision making in managing COVID-19
- Collected through Google products such as Google Maps
- Data reports percent change in movement across places in comparison to the median trend seen between _Jan. 3, 2020_ and _Feb. 5, 2020_
- Used to identify counties with the highest drop in workplace visits, potentially as a result of a county-level stay-at-home order

## Changepoint Analysis
- Changepoint detection technique used to determine the change in workplace mobility curve before a statewide stay-at-home was order implemented
- Specifically, At-Most-One-Change (AMOC) method used to identify a single point of significant change 
- Mean of workplace mobility calculated pre and post changepoint for every county
- Counties with the lowest mean for workplace visits post changepoint prioritized in the data collection process

## Change in Mobility by County

## Interventions & COVID-19 Cases Curve
- Database Creation: Collecting County & State SAH Intervention Data for U.S
- Data Table
```{r}
datatable(county_interventions)
```

## Before & During Interventions
```{r}
county_interventions_cases_sl <- county_intervention_cases %>% select(admin1, SAH_State_Date,cases, cases_2day_before, cases_week_after, cases_2week_after, cases_4week_after) %>% distinct(admin1, SAH_State_Date,cases, cases_2day_before, cases_week_after, cases_2week_after, cases_4week_after)

#as.data.frame(county_interventions_cases_sl)

## Rationale- NOAH 
- Why we collected the attributes we did?
- Variety of variables that could have influenced a later SAH order

-Covid-19 is a dynamic and easily spreadable virus. 
- Policy for COVID-19 has been decided on by governors in particular
- Expressing a Governor's political party will build overall trends in decision making for the US as a whole 
- The population is one of the largest factors in a factor in a pandemic.
      For example, New and NJ lead in terms of cases and are large population centers.(worldometers.info/coronavirus)
-Cases are the backbone for understanding the spread of disease. 
-Intervention types across the US were very different from Stay at home minors, to shelter in place
  - Interventions also occurred across both March of 2020 and April 2020
  
## Pop vs Intervention Date- NOAH




-This chart shows the intervention date with the total population of the state. N/A for the party is for territory without a governor.  
There is a clear difference in the political party's by the state for the state's intervention date. Democrats tend to be earlier by the republicans were later in March and early April.

-This chart was created using ggplot
## Political Party vs State Intervention Date- NOAH




-This chart shows the intervention type (policy type) with a political party. 
-Overall it shows the bipartisan policy between states for a stay at home order. It is also interesting to see a lack of shelter in place order between the states. 
-The chart shows the clear dominance geographically of the stay at home order.

-Note this table leaves off 9 states that have no SAH order (of any type)

-This chart was created using ggplot

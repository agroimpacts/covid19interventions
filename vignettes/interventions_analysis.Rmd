#How many cases and deaths were recorded the date the intervention measures were put in place?

#1.Loop through all counties in the list to find the dates and number of cases&deaths for before, during, and after interventions were put in place. 



#2.Then do a plot where the date is on the x axis and the number of cases and deaths are on the y axis.




#3.After plotting those two lines find the places that showed the highest and lowest drops due to the intervention or lack thereof.
